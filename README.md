Using fortune information with big companies statistics in 2018 I explored the features of PowerBI from Microsoft. An excellent data preparation and visualization tool, free for a user.

The version I tested though being free does not omit many features. The main difference is that I could not publish the information online, but I was able to export to PDF with a presentation of excellent quality.
The PowerBI tool is powerful and easy. all the technical questions of JOIN tables, REPLACE the values, CONCATENATE for new columns and an easy connection of the information with geographic maps. Information with geographic maps can be obtained through latitude and longitude coordinates, or through state and city.

The tool provides various forms of data entry. The most basic is excel or csv, because it's an easy way they can obtain tabulated data.

Another great feature is the automatic creation of SCRIPTS as you apply changes to the table or data. In this way, whenever the data from the source table is updated, the system applies the modification and correction of data scripts so that it can be viewed.

Visualization offers a wide range of graphic possibilities, from bar charts, PIE charts, stacked bar graphs, and graphs to geographic maps.

The coloring of the graphics can be customized, and the system presents placement according to the values ​​of a column, allowing in this way to give a greater visualization in the characteristics that have greater value.
Now, using the information published in Fortune 2018, i present some graphs with the information. All work and CSV table information can be consulted in Github.
